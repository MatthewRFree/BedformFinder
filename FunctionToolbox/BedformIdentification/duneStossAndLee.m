function [lengthStoss, lengthLee, heightStoss, heightLee] = duneStossAndLee(x1, y1, x2, y2)
% DUNESTOSSANDLEE Calculates the stoss and lee values from x1, y1, x2, y2
%   DUNESTOSSANDLEE calculates the horizontal length and vertical height of
%   the stoss and lee formed from the leading trough and peak as well as
%   the peak and lagging trough.
%
%   [...] = DUNESTOSSANDLEE(X1,Y1,X2,Y2) takes four vectors corresponding to 
%   the x and y locations of peaks and troughs. X1 and Y1 must be troughs 
%   and X2 and Y2 must be peaks. X1 and X2 are measured in miles and Y1 and 
%   Y2 are measured in feet.
%
%   [LENGTHSTOSS,LENGTHLEE,HEIGHTSTOSS,HEIGHTLEE] = DUNESTOSSANDLEE(...)
%   returns the vectors LENGTHSTOSS which are the stoss lengths, LENGTHLEE
%   which are the lee lengths, HEIGHTSTOSS which are the stoss heights, and
%   HEIGHTLEE which are the lee heights.
