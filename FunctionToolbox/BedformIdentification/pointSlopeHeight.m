function [height, slope] = pointSlopeHeight(x1, y1, x2, y2)
% POINTSLOPEHEIGHT computes vertical height of dunes
%   POINTSLOPEHEIGHT calculates the vertical distance between a dune peak
%   and the intersection with the line formed by an inclined slope between
%   the surrounding two troughs. Uses the point slope form equation for
%   calculations.
%
%   [HEIGHT,SLOPE] = POINTSLOPEHEIGHT(X1,Y1,X2,Y2) takes four vectors
%   corresponding to the x and y locations of peaks and troughs. X1 and Y1 
%   must be troughs and X2 and Y2 must be peaks. Returns a vector HEIGHT
%   with each height and a vector SLOPE with the inclined slope betweem troughs.
%   X1 and X2 are measured in miles and Y1 and Y2 are measured in feet.
